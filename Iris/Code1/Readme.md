## Execution

Make sure the dependencies are installed for the python program to work.

Put the images for 2 individuals in dataset/main_folder/folder1 and dataset/main_folder/folder2 respectively (main_folder, folder1, folder2 names can be anything of your choice but it should follow the directory structure).

Run pipeline.py. It should display the images as it executes. The images are set to be displayed till you close them. In one run 2 images are displayed. Save them manually if you wish to.
